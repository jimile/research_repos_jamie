# UX and UI Design for Brutalist Websites

## Introduction

Brutalist web design is known for its raw and unapologetically bold aesthetics. When designing a brutalist website, it's essential to maintain a balance between unconventional visual elements and a user-friendly experience. Here are some key principles and code snippets to consider:

## UX Design Principles

### 1. Clarity and Simplicity

Brutalist websites often have a minimalistic approach. Keep your design simple and straightforward to avoid overwhelming users.

### 2. User Flow

Ensure a clear and intuitive user flow. Make navigation and interactions easy to understand.

## UI Design Principles

### 1. Typography

Choose bold and legible fonts. Experiment with font sizes and styles to create visual impact.

```css
/* Example: Setting font style */
.body-text {
    font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: 400;
}

/* Example: Styling a CTA button */
.cta-button {
    background-color: #f60;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    font-weight: bold;
}
