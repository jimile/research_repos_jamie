## Introduction

In this project, I aimed to create a fully functional e-commerce webstore that not only provides a seamless shopping experience but also serves as a playground for my exploration of various programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, C++, and more. I believe that combining solid UX principles with a diverse tech stack is key to building an exceptional e-commerce platform.

## UX Research

To ensure a user-centric design, I conducted extensive UX research, including:

- User personas and scenarios
- Usability testing and feedback collection
- Information architecture and wireframing
- Visual design and prototyping

I integrated these research findings into the webstore's design to optimize user experience and satisfaction.

## Programming Language Research

As part of my commitment to continuous learning, I experimented with several programming languages within this project. I explored:

- JavaScript for interactive frontend features
- Ruby for backend logic and data handling
- HTML/CSS for web layout and styling
- C++ for exploring performance enhancements

I've documented my experiences and code snippets for each language within the project.

## Code Snippets

This repository includes code snippets that demonstrate my progress in implementing various features of the e-commerce webstore. You can find them in the following directories:

- [JavaScript Snippets](./javascript-snippets)
- [Ruby Snippets](./ruby-snippets)
- [HTML/CSS Snippets](./html-css-snippets)
- [C++ Snippets](./cpp-snippets)

Feel free to explore and provide feedback on these code snippets!
