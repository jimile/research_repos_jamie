## Introduction

In this project, I aimed to create a fully functional e-commerce webstore that not only provides a seamless shopping experience but also serves as a playground for my exploration of various programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, C++, and more. I believe that combining solid UX principles with a diverse tech stack is key to building an exceptional e-commerce platform.

## UX Research

To ensure a user-centric design, I conducted extensive UX research, including:

- User personas and scenarios
- Usability testing and feedback collection
- Information architecture and wireframing
- Visual design and prototyping

I integrated these research findings into the webstore's design to optimize user experience and satisfaction.

## Programming Language Research

As part of my commitment to continuous learning, I experimented with several programming languages within this project. I explored:

- JavaScript for interactive frontend features
- Ruby for backend logic and data handling
- HTML/CSS for web layout and styling
- C++ for exploring performance enhancements

I've documented my experiences and code snippets for each language within the project.
